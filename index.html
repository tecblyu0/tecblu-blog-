		<h1 class="textcenter">The Apocalypse Girl</h1>
		<p>In a world of shadows, where undead souls reside, A little girl, fearless, in darkness did stride. With courage as her armor, she faced the undead horde, Her spirit unyielding, her heart firmly stored.</p>
		<p>Through desolate streets, where fear gripped tight, She stood, unbroken, in the dead of night. Her steps were silent, her gaze steadfast and clear, No fear in her eyes, no hint of a tear.</p>
		<p>Zombies lurked in corners, in alleys, they crept, But the girl, unwavering, her vigilance, she kept. With nimble feet and a mind sharp and keen, She outwitted, outlasted, in this nightmarish scene.</p>
		<p>Her weapon, not steel, nor a gun, nor blade, But her wit and her wisdom, her courage arrayed. She danced amidst danger, her spirit aglow, Each victory she claimed, a triumph to show.</p>
		<p>No matter the odds, no matter the fright, The girl never faltered, she battled through night. Surviving each onslaught, she stood tall, unbowed, A beacon of hope in a world disavowed.</p>
		<p>For her tale echoes loudly, a lesson profound, That strength lies within, in hearts that resound. Against all odds, she continued to strive, The girl who fought zombies and emerged alive.</p>
